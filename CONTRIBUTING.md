## Pull request guidelines

Before working on a pull request, create an issue explaining what you want to contribute. This ensures that your pull request won't go unnoticed, and that you are not contributing something that is not suitable for the project. The pull request description should reference the original issue.

Your pull request must:

 * Follow OLR's coding style.

 * Pass the integration tests run automatically by the Travis Continuous
   Integration system.

 * Address a single issue or add a single item of functionality.

 * Use clear commit messages in Angular standard.

 * Be possible to merge automatically.


### Address a single issue or add a single item of functionality

Please submit separate pull requests for separate issues.  This allows each to
be reviewed on its own merits.


### Use clear commit messages

Commit messages should be short, and appropriately typed and scoped. We follow
https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines
for the formatting of commit messages.

> NOTE that general changes should be typed as **chore**, minor/major changes should be typed as **feat**.

Git commit message should look like:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Please keep the type, scope and subject line short, no more than 50 characters.
